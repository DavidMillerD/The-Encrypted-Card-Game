# The Encrypted Card Game 🎯🔐

A fully decentralized on-chain card battle game powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology, enabling truly private gameplay where card types remain hidden until revealed through strategic combat.

## 🎮 Game Overview

The Encrypted Card Game is a strategic battle arena where players deploy encrypted card armies in head-to-head combat. Built on the rock-paper-scissors principle with three distinct card types:

- **🦅 Eagle (0)**: Dominates Snake, vulnerable to Bear
- **🐻 Bear (1)**: Crushes Eagle, falls to Snake
- **🐍 Snake (2)**: Defeats Bear, loses to Eagle

### Game Mechanics

Each player commands a deck of **6 cards**, each starting with **2 health points**. Players engage in turn-based combat where:

1. **Secret Deployment**: Cards are encrypted on submission, keeping opponents blind to your strategy
2. **Simultaneous Reveals**: Both players play one card per round
3. **Combat Resolution**: Cards battle based on type advantages and health
4. **Victory Condition**: The last player with surviving cards claims victory

The encryption ensures complete information asymmetry - your opponent cannot predict your moves, making every battle a test of pure strategy and psychological warfare.
